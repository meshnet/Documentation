                                    ABSTRACT

            The Node to Node protocol (N2NP) is intended for use as a
       reliable host‐to‐host protocol between node devices (hosts) in
       packet‐switched embedded computer communication networks over
       radio waves.

       This document describes the function to be performed by the Node
       to Node Protocol, the programs that implement it, and its inter‐
       face through a kernel device driver.

1.  INTRODUCTION

1.1.  Scope of this document

  N2NP is a transport and applicative layer for the MeshNet project. It provides
  communication between two nodes through radio signals. The physical layer
  (radio) is not yet defined as of this day, and it’s not in the scope of this
  document. This document shall describe the internal mechanisms of the proto‐
  col, and its integration within the MeshNet project.

  The N2NP is over the physical layer [Figure 1] The physical layer is charged
  with transportation of the packet, and will be likely over radio waves with
  low frequencies. That implies very low bandwidth, and the protocol must be
  designed with this requirement in mind.  Since it does not handle transporta‐
  tion, the N2NP can focus on the Routing and the data side of a communication.
  It is assumed that if a packet is not compliant with this specification, a
  client should drop it.

2.3.  Device Identification

  In order to identify a device uniquely, the N2NP uses a hashed identifier with
  a length of 4 bytes. The original hashed content and the size of those fields
  are not finally decided yet, so those are subject to change.  In a packet, the
  protocol shall define a source identifier (FROM) and a destination identifier
  (TO). These fields are to be used by the neighboring nodes in order to relay
  the packet to its final destination. Since a node can have multiple neighbors,
  and assuming the physical layer of the protocol (radio) can’t handle a non‐
  broadcast emission, a third ID is used; It describes the physical neighbor
  that will relay this packet. If the final destination node is within physical
  reach, this field is useless, and its value should be set to ’0’ (zero).


2.4.  Packet Type

  In order to perform multiple actions, a packet type, 1 byte in length, is set
  in the packet. This field contains a common integer that describes the type of
  action to be performed. Read the Type * sections for more information about
  them.


2.5.  Payload

  The payload of a packet (Data, in the Frame in 2.2) is filled with data.  This
  field does not have a fixed size, and its content depends on the packet type.
  For example, a PING will not have any data.


2.6.  Version & Length

  The first byte of the packet is used to describe the protocol version. The
  first 4 bits are used for the major version, the last 4 bits for the minor
  version.

                              Example version byte

                          0100 .... = Major Version 4
                          .... 0101 = Minor Version 5

  The length field describes the total length of the packet, starting from byte
  0 of the N2NP header and ending at the last byte of the data field.

3.  PACKET TYPES

3.1.  PING

  The PING packet type describes an action to test the reachability and the
  availability of a device. This type does not have any data associeated with
  it.  On a PING a device shall respond with a PONG in order to assure the orig‐
  inal sender of its reachability.  It is described with the value 0x1 (1) in
  the packet type field.

                           Typical ping‐pong exchange

                          CLIENT_1 ‐> PING ‐> CLIENT_2
                          CLIENT_1 <‐ PONG <‐ CLIENT_2


3.2.  PONG

  The PONG packet type describes a response to a previous PING packet. It is
  used to assure the availability of the receiver to the original sender.  PONG
  is an obligatory response to a PING packet. If a client does not respond to a
  PING with a PONG, the original sender will assume that the receiver is not
  reachable. This type does not have any data paired with.  It is described with
  the value 0x2 (2) in the packet type field.


3.3.  SERVICE

  The SERVICE packet is used to describe a payload type, in order for the
  receiver to know what type of data will follow the header. If a SERVICE type
  is specified, a data payload MUST follow the header. A data payload shall
  always be in the following frame:

3.4.  PEERS

  The PEERS packet type describes the state of a node with its neighbors. It can
  be used for different purposes, when a client is joining the network, to
  update the score of a peer or when a node looses a peer. It is described with
  the value 0x4 (4) in the packet type field.

  The Score field describes the current score of the Device ID node perceived by
  the source node; It is used to choose a best path when routing is needed.  The
  Device ID describes the peer device ID on 4 bytes.

  Those packets are broadcast by nature; if a client happens to receive a PEERS
  packet, the Destination Device Identifier in the N2NP header shall be set to
  0. Upon joining, a new node wanting to announce itself on the network must use
  a PEER packet: it announces the current peers of the node, and their score.
  For peer list and score calculation, see the relevant section. It is also used
  when a node want to announce an update on his peers: a peer has been lost, a
  peer score has changed, or a new peer has arrived.

  Upon reception of a PEER packet, a client must update his internal routing ta‐
  ble with the information in the PEER packet. A routing table entry consists of
  two things: the mother device ID, and a list of paired score‐IDS of the peers
  linked with the mother device. It could be represented like this:

    struct {
        uint32_t        node_id;

        struct {
            uint8_t             score;
            uint32_t            id;
            struct list_head    next;
        } neighbors;
    };

  The PEER packet is join‐agnostic: a client receiving a packet must not care if
  the sender just joined the network or is just updating information about his
  peers. The client must update his internal routing table either way, and cre‐
  ate a new entry when it is required. A C representation of the routing table
  could be:

    typedef struct {
        struct node_entry_s {
            uint32_t    node_id;

            struct {
                uint8_t                 score;
                struct node_entry_s     *id;
                struct list_head        next;
            };

            struct list_head            next;
        };
    } routing_table_t;

  It is worth noting that a pointer or a 32 bits unsigned int for the ID field
  will be the same thing, as both types takes 4 bytes in ARMv5l. Theoretically,
  an entry will size 25 bytes in memory; In practice, GCC will align the struct
  on an 8 byte word, therefore padding the structure up to 32 bytes.

4.1.  CHAT


  The CHAT service is used to describe a chat message between two or more users.
  It is described by the value 0x1 (1) in the service type field.

4.1.1.  Sequence Number

  The Sequence Number field is used to describe a sequence in the communication.
  This information is useful to the devices in order to track a progression in a
  communication. On the beginning of a session, the first packet sender shall
  set this field to 0. The mechanic behind it is the same as TCP [1] , the

DARD (September 1981).

  receiver shall increment this field with the length of the data it received.

                          Example of a communication

      CLIENT_1 ‐>      CHAT "Hello", MSG, sequence_number = 0        ‐> CLIENT_2
      CLIENT_1 <‐ CHAT "Hey there !", MSG & ACK, sequence_number = 5 <‐ CLIENT_2
      CLIENT_1 ‐>          CHAT, ACK, sequence_number = 17           ‐> CLIENT_2

  The ACK flag is described in the 4.1.3 section.  If a sequence number exceeds
  the maximum value of a 2 byte integer the client that will overflow the
  sequence number shall start over at 1.

4.1.2.  Flags

  The Flags field is used to describe multiple boolean informations

                               1... .... = ACK
                               .1.. .... = CHA
                               ..1. .... = FRG
                               ...1 .... = MSG
                               .... 1... = CRT
                               .... .1.. = UPD
                               .... ..1. = Reserved
                               .... ...1 = Reserved

  The ACK flag describes an acknowledgment of data. If the ACK flag is set, the
  sequence number field shall contain the sequence of the data acknowledged.

  The CHA flag describes a message that is to be sent to multiple people (a
  Channel). If this flag is set, the payload will not be a simple UTF‐8 message,
  but rather this payload:

  The Channel ID, 2 bytes in legth, describes the ID of a channel that a client
  wants to pass his message to. This ID is handled with the CRT message
  mechanic, see the appropriate section for more information. This packet is, in
  essence, a broadcast; The destination device ID should be set to 0. Every
  client must relay this message to their neighbors, and log it internally. This
  way, when a client joins a channel, it will have a history (at least from the

  moment he joined the network). When a client wants to join / leave a channel,
  he will be doing this internally, without announcing it to the network.

  A client must deduce the data length from the following math:

                   chat‐>message_length ‐ sizeof(CHA‐>channel_id)

  The FRG flag describes a fragmentation of data. If this flag is set, the
  receiver shall expect one or more further packets in order to complete the
  data.

                         Incorrect fragmented exchange:

              CLIENT_1 ‐> CHAT "Hello", FRG & MSG, seq = 0 ‐> CLIENT_2
              CLIENT_1 <‐        CHAT, ACK, seq = 5        <‐ CLIENT_2
              CLIENT_1 ‐>   CHAT "World !", MSG, seq = 0   ‐> CLIENT_2
              CLIENT_1 <‐        CHAT, ACK, seq = 12       <‐ CLIENT_2

    In the example above, one can see that CLIENT_2 ACKed the data before
    the reception of the second and final packet: this is not standard;
    CLIENT_1 shall not wait for an acknowledgment of data before sending more
    fragmented packets. The exchange above should have happened like this:

                          Correct fragmented exchange:

              CLIENT_1 ‐> CHAT "Hello", FRG & MSG, seq = 0 ‐> CLIENT_2
              CLIENT_1 ‐>   CHAT "World !", MSG, seq = 0   ‐> CLIENT_2
              CLIENT_1 <‐       CHAT, ACK, seq = 12        <‐ CLIENT_2

  A client must unset the FRG flag when sending the final packet of fragmented
  data; otherwise the other client will wait indefinitely for another packet.

  The MSG flag describes a standard chat exchange: the payload will be nothing
  more than a normal UTF‐8 message. This flag cannot be set with the CHA flag.

  The CRT flag describes the creation of a channel to the entire network, and
  announce a channel ID with a human‐readable name. If this flag is set, the
  payload will not be a simple UTF‐8 message, but rather this payload:

  The channel ID will be used for all the exchanges to come on this particular
  channel: A client must save it internally. If a CHA message would arrive, and
  a client did not know the concerned ID, this packet must be queued waiting for
  a CRT packet to come.

  In case of a join / re‐join, when a client was not connected during the time
  of the creation of a channel, this client, upon reception of a CHA packet,
  must ask his direct neighbors an update of his internal channel ID table. He
  will be doing so using the UPD flag.

  The UPD flag describes a request from a client whose internal channel ID table
  is outdated, whether he was disonnected at the time of the creation, or simply
  miss it, to his direct neighbors. The payload shall be simply:

  The ACK and UPD flag must be set for this response.  In the case where the
  neighbor does not know the channel ID either, it must ask his neighbors (minus
  the original sender) for this information, following the same process. Upon
  reception of the response, it must update his table, and pass the information

  cast is valid starting from the Issued timestamp. Clients should be doing the
  following addition in order to check the validity of a broadcast

5.  ROUTING

Within the N2NP protocol, routing is done in a special way. Since the network
mesh is router‐less, the routing protocol needs to be gateway agnostic. We also
have low‐data requirements due to the physical transportation limitation.  Also,
as a node on the network may be moving, high reliability is a must.

The entire routing is based on the principle that all nodes on the network know
every node’s neighbors; therefore, every node can determine a path for every
packet.


5.1.  Peer Information

  Peer’s neighbors are not the only information provided by every host on the
  network; every host assigns a score to their neighbors, based on signal
  strength and distance. This value is to be used in the heuristic algorithm in
  order to evaluate the weight of a path.


5.1.1.  Score calculation

  A score describes the state of a node from the point of view of another node.
  Those two nodes must be within physical reach of each other for a score to be
  determined: it is used as weight value for the path‐finding heuristic.  A
  score is determined through the following equation / heuristic:

           /!\ To be determined, needs to be on one byte maximum /!\


5.1.2.  Update Broadcast

  This broadcast is launched when one of the following conditions are met: ‐ A
  new node is joining the network ‐ An existing node got a new neighbor (New
  client or a moving node) ‐ A node has timed out ‐ A peer score has changed

  In all of these cases, the main node needs to update the whole network with
  this new information; In order to calculate a path reliably, every node on the
  network must know the neighbors of everyone: it is not intended to be a real‐
  time information, but rather an indicative information.  In order to do that,
  the node must send a PEERS packet with all the neighbors information. If a
  peer did timeout, the main node must sent a PEER entry with a score of 0
  (zero). If a peer did not change score, the main node must not add it in its
  PEERS packet.







MeshNet                                                                [Page 16]

5.1.3.  Update broadcast data optimization

  In order to optimize usage of data bandwidth, broadcast peer update data must
  be packed whenever possible.

  If a node B is to retransmit the update data of the node A, and the node B
  itself has broadcast data in the output pipe, the B node must pack the node A
  information with it’s information, and send only one packet to be relayed by
  its peers.

  Of course, this packed data length should not exceed the packet maximum size,
  otherwise the first packet must be relayed without re‐writing, and the second
  one sent as well. A client, receiving broadcast update data from multiple
  clients in one packet must deduce the number of nodes implicated by looking at
  the total length in the N2NP header.


5.2.  ROUTING ALGORITHM

When a packet is sent from one device with the intent of speaking to a another
device directly, routing must be involved. In order to assure delivering reli‐
ably, the N2NP uses a mix between the HEAT algorithm, with node score attribu‐
tion, and a static route routing algorithm. You can find the details about score
attribution in the relevant section, along with the routing table information.


5.2.1.  General Description

  The concept of this routing algorithm is quite simple: every node bound to
  route a packet from node A to node B must determine which route is the best,
  on every hop.

  Let’s say we have node A wanting to send a packet to node Z; the simple sce‐
  nario is that those two nodes are physically next to each other: therefore, no
  routing is needed.

  But, if those two nodes are not directly connected to each other, node A must
  determine the best route to reach node Z. In order to do that, and with all
  the information about all the nodes on the network (See PEERS), node A must
  run a heuristic algorithm on all his peer nodes (physically connected) with
  the score of each node as weight.

  In order not to loose time in the process, the depth used for the algorithm
  should be minimal: node A does not need to determine an exact perfect path all
  the way to node Z, but rather choose the direct peer that will be most suited
  to route this packet.

  Let’s take the above schema: node A still wants to reach node Z.  In order to
  do that, node A must determine the best path through one of his direct peers;
  in this case it’s quite simple; node A only has one peer.

  Node A sends the packet to node B, and it’s now the turn of node B to deter‐
  mine the best path through one of his direct peers. Here, we got two peer
  nodes: C and G. With the score of both it’s direct peers, and all the ones
  beyond these, node B must now determine the best path to route this packet.

  It is important to note that node B’s internal routing table, that describes
  all the scores of everyone on the network, does not need to be updated in real
  time: the node can determine a good‐enough path to the next hop with its data.

  Let’s say, for the sake of the example, that node C has a score of 40, and G a
  score of 55. Since both C and G share the same output node, D, their exit
  score will be the same. So the node B must compare the score of C and G in
  order to route the packet properly.

  In this example, G got a bigger score than C, so node B will route the packet
  to G. Node G, upon reception, will do the same algorithm in order to route the
  packet to the next node, and the next node will do the same, and so on until
  the destination node is reached.



5.2.2.  Dijkstra’s algorithm

  In order to compute the best path for a packet, a node must use Dijkstra’s
  algorithm [2]. Instead of using distance as a sole weight parameter, the score
  of the nodes is to be used. See the relevant sections for score calculations.


5.2.3.  Broadcast routing

  By nature, broadcast packets do not have a destination: All the members of the
  networks shall receive the packet. Therefore, the routing algorithm cannot be
  used in this case. A flood routing algorithm shall be used.

                             Simple 4 nodes network

                                     Node A
                                    /     \
                               Node B     Node D
                                    \     /
                                     Node C

  Lets take the above schema: in this example, node A wants to broadcast a
  packet to the network: first, it will send it to his direct neighbors: B and
  D. Before sending, the node must compute a checksum of the full packet, start‐
  ing at the N2NP header, and store it.

  The node D, upon reception of the packet, and before treatment in userland,
  must do the same: compute a checksum, and send the packet to his direct neigh‐
  bors, A and C. C has never seen the packet before: therefore it will compute
  and relay it.

  But the node A has already seen the packet (Since he’s the one who sent it).
  So, upon reception, A will compute the checksum, check with his internal stor‐
  age, see that this packet has already been relayed, and simply drop it.

  With this method, we keep simplicity through routing, without much data over‐
  head and broadcast replay problems.


5.2.4.  Protocol routing

  When the next peer ID has been determined, the node must physically route and
  send the packet to the said node. In order to do that, the field ’Next Physi‐
  cal Device Identifier’ in the header (Section 2.2 Frame) must be set to this
  ID.

  The two other fields, Source / Destination ID, should not be changed in any
  way by a relay‐node; it is not necessary.

  Upon reception of a packet, a node should look at those fields:

  ‐ If the Destination Device ID is his ID and the Next Physical ID is set to 0,
  the packet should be sent to userspace for treatment.

  ‐ If the Destination Device ID is not his ID but the Next Physical ID is, the
  packet should not leave kernel‐space and be properly relayed according to this
  specification (Section 5 ROUTING).

  ‐ Otherwise, the packet should be dropped.
